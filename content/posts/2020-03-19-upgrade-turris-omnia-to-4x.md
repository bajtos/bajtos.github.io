I have been sold on the promise of a high-performance extensible home router
running open-source firmware and OS all the way back in 2015/2016, when the team
behind the Czech national domain registrar ([CZ.NIC](https://www.nic.cz/))
announced their Indiegogo campaign for
[Turris Omnia](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/turris-omnia-hi-performance-open-source-router).
The campaign was a big success, it has raised over \$1.2M USD. Since then, the
team kept working on further improvements of the operating system and in October
2019, they released a new major version
[Turris OS 4.0](https://forum.turris.cz/t/turris-os-4-0-is-out/11182).
Unfortunately, the migration from 3.x is not automated, which I found a bit
disappointing. An important reason for choosing somewhat-expensive Omnia was the
promise of frequent and fully-automated updates ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

One of my biggest pain points with Omnia have been unreliable wifi. While
Android and Windows PC devices work fine, my Apple devices (iPhone and MacBook
Pro) often end up in a weird state when the device shows wifi connection but
HTTP requests never get back. Recently, another Omnia user posted a nice summary
of the problem and possible solution
[in the forum](https://forum.turris.cz/t/turris-os-4-0-6-is-released-into-hbt-branch/12151/18),
so I decided to invest some time into tinkering with the router with the hope of
getting a reliable wifi again. (Troy Hunt‚Äôs recent blog post
[Friends Don‚Äôt Let Friends Use Dodgy WiFi](https://www.troyhunt.com/friends-dont-let-friends-use-dodgy-wifi-introducing-ubiquitis-dream-machine-and-flexhd/)
was another nudge.)

I decided to bite the bullet and start with upgrading Turris OS to the latest
and greatest (?) version 4.x. It turns out the upgrade is super easy, as long as
you don‚Äôt mind loosing your existing configuration. üôà While it‚Äôs possible to
save the 3.x config and then restore it in 4.x version, such operation breaks
the router in subtle but important ways (automatic update no longer works,
OpenWRT thinks there is a misconfigured virtual LAN switch, etc.).

Fortunately, my config is very simple. Besides the usual WLAN, LAN and wifi
setup, I used OpenWRT‚Äôs LuCI web interface to tweak `txpower` setting of both
wifi adapters to lower values‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI don‚Äôt want to be ‚Äúgrilled‚Äù by microwaves more
than necessary.

Here is a step-by-step guide, I hope you will find it helpful. I could not find
anything similar in Turris Omnia documentation or the forum, which speaks for
itself. ü§®

1.  Review your current configuration, both in Foris and LuCI interfaces. Write
    down important settings like wifi channels and any other settings you will
    want to restore after upgrade.
2.  Find a USB drive, prepare a LAN (Ethernet) cable and a USB-LAN dongle for
    your computer if needed.
3.  Follow the instructions for
    [re-flashing the router from USB](https://docs.turris.cz/hw/omnia/rescue_modes/#re-flash-router):

> Download the latest version of Turris Omnia‚Äôs system image from
> [https://repo.turris.cz/hbs/medkit/omnia-medkit-latest.tar.gz](https://repo.turris.cz/hbs/medkit/omnia-medkit-latest.tar.gz).
> Save the file `omnia-medkit-latest.tar.gz` to USB flash drive to the root
> directory. (‚Ä¶) Connect the USB flash to the Turris Omnia router and use reset
> button to select mode 4 (4 LEDs).

4. Wait until the operation completes and the router starts.

5. Connect to your router via LAN cable, open the administrative interface at
[http://192.168.1.1/](http://192.168.1.1/) and follow the Guided Mode to
manually restore your router config.

6. If you are tweaking advanced settings, open also LuCI to make the necessary
changes there.

As far as I can tell so far, the 4.x configuration UI looks pretty much the same
as in 3.x and the Guided Mode makes the manual restore process very quick. The
most notable difference is the introduction of ‚ÄúNetwork Interfaces‚Äù section,
where you can assign different network devices (WAN, LAN, WLAN) to different
zones: WAN, LAN, Guest Network. Here is how the default setup looks like:

My next step is to tweak 2.4 GHz wifi to see if I can get a stable connection,
but that‚Äôs a story for another day‚Ä¶
